Over the last 10 years, adoptions have become much more complex and risky. At one time, the Utah Adoption Act was designed to make it clear whether a child can be adopted. But as judges have changed their view about the legal nature of family relationships, the legislature has tried to catch up, resulting in statutes that are difficult to apply, procedures that are uncertain and risks that are real. While in the past an attorney that is a family friend may have been able to get through an adoption, it now requires someone who is familiar with adoption rules, practices and court staff. 

We have handled over 1000 adoption cases, including over 500 finalizations. We have handled dozens of contested adoptions and we know how to avoid them. Whether the adoption is through an agency or a private placement, whether it is international, domestic or interstate, whether the children are infants or grown, whether the person adopting is a step-parent, relative or unrelated, we handle the case competently, effectively, and inexpensively.
