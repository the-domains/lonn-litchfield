Every organization acts through people. Often, employees do or say things that prevent the organization from doing the what it exists to do. This happens despite an employee's best intentions. We almost always try to change bad actions by making rules that prohibit anyone from making that choice again. But this almost never works--in fact, it often makes things worse.
Ethics is the study of making good choices. Almost everyone values loyalty, accountability, avoiding conflicts of interest, honesty, preserving confidences, and disseminating information. Rather than making and enforcing rules that restrict the choices employees make, an organization should train its employees to aspire to make better choices and to inspire others to make better choices, and then allow them to make good choices. Focusing on ethics improves what employees do and lifts morale while helping the organization accomplish its objectives more quickly and less expensively. We help organizations harness the power of ethics. We help organizations harness the power of ethics.
