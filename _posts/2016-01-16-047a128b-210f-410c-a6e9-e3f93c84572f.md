Civil litigation is an enormous burden to those involved. We know how to lift that burden. Most people don't want to have a conflict, but sometimes they find themselves unable to move ahead until a dispute is resolved. That's when they need someone who understands how courts resolve disputes. We have years of experience litigating complex cases, from business disputes to regulatory matters to family cases. 

In particular, we have helped many great people resolve personal injury and wrongful death cases. We know that by aggressively preparing every case as if it is going all the way to trial we increase the chances to settle before we get there. We have handled everything from simple car accident cases with minor injuries to heartbreaking deaths. We really enjoy being able to help.
